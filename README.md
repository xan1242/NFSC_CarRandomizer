# NFS Carbon - Car Randomizer

This is a car randomizer for NFS Carbon.

With each race finish, you get a different car!

## Installation

Simply extract the .asi and .ini files and place them in the `scripts` directory in your game installation!

If you do not have the `scripts` directory, make sure you also have the [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/latest) installed!

## Notes/caveats

1. Tutorial test drive is disabled due to instabilities
2. It's best to do the DDay and tutorial without car randomizer first and then enable it later
3. Sometimes cars have transparent paint
4. There are no `presetride` cars, only `pvehicle` cars. In layman terms - this means that cars are (usually) going to be stock.
5. Sometimes cars don't have sound or have double engine sound (usually happens after 2nd car, go to FE and back to restore)
6. It's best to save the game after every boss just in case
7. Sometimes the game may crash and/or softlock in a infinite loading screen -- this is because of sounds. If you want the most stable experience, you can disable sound by setting `NoSound` to 1 in the ini configuration file and temporarily disabling movies by renaming the MOVIES directory in the game installation.
8. Cops disappear after car switching - this is normal
9. Loading screens are slightly longer. Don't be alarmed, this is normal. The sounds are being reloaded each time the car swaps.
10. If the game gets stuck because you have totaled your car or something similar, you can try pressing `Ctrl+F9` to unload the track and go back to FE instantly.
