1. Tutorial test drive is disabled due to instabilities
2. It's best to do the DDay and tutorial without car randomizer first and then enable it later
3. Sometimes cars have transparent paint
4. Sometimes cars don't have sound or have double engine sound (usually happens after 2nd car, go to FE and back to restore)
5. It's best to save the game after every boss just in case
6. Sometimes the game may crash and/or softlock in a infinite loading screen -- this is because of sounds. If you want the most stable experience, you can disable sound by either launching the game with the "-nosound" argument, or making a "nosound.txt" file next to the ASI
7. Cops disappear after car switching - this is normal
8. Loading screens are slightly longer. Don't be alarmed, this is normal. The sounds are being reloaded each time the car swaps.
