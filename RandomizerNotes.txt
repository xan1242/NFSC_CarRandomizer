INSTALLATION:
Place the .asi file in "scripts" folder where your game is installed. In case you don't have it, create it and ensure you have Ultimate ASI Loader installed.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
You can use these either:
- as command line arguments (e.g. "NFSC.exe -rndcars_notraffic -rndcars_nocops" to disable traffic and cop cars)
- or as txt files next to the .asi (e.g. in Windows, right click -> New -> Text Document, then name the file as "rndcars_notraffic.txt")

rndcars_noregular    = Exclude the regular car list
rndcars_notraffic    = Exclude the traffic car list
rndcars_includesemis = Include the semis with traffic
rndcars_nocops       = Exclude the cop car list
nosound              = Disables the game sound (could help with stability)

NOTES/CAVEATS:
1. Tutorial test drive is disabled due to instabilities
2. It's best to do the DDay and tutorial without car randomizer first and then enable it later
3. Sometimes cars have transparent paint
4. Sometimes cars don't have sound or have double engine sound (usually happens after 2nd car, go to FE and back to restore)
5. It's best to save the game after every boss just in case
6. Sometimes the game may crash and/or softlock in a infinite loading screen -- this is because of sounds. If you want the most stable experience, you can disable sound by either launching the game with the "-nosound" argument, or making a "nosound.txt" file next to the ASI
7. Cops disappear after car switching - this is normal
8. Loading screens are slightly longer. Don't be alarmed, this is normal. The sounds are being reloaded each time the car swaps.
9. If the game gets stuck because you have totaled your car or something similar, you can try pressing Ctrl+F9 to unload the track and go back to FE instantly.
